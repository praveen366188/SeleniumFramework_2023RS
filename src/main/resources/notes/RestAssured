HTTP methods which are commonly used to communicate with Rest API’s are

GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE

GET- The GET method is used to extract information from the given
server using a given URI. While using GET request, it should only extract data and should have no other effect on the data. No Payload/Body required

Ans: Using Query Parameters


POST- A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

What is URI in REST API with example?
URIs are identifiers of resources that work across the Web. A URI consists of a scheme (such as http and https ),
a host (such as www.example.org ),
a port number followed by a path with one or more segments (such as /users/1234 ),
and a query string.



PUT- Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

DELETE- Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.



Resources:
Resources represent API/Collection which can be accessed from the Server

Google.com/maps
google.com/search
google.com/images


Path Parameters:
Path parameters are variable parts of a URL path. They are typically used to point to a specific resource within a collection,
such as a user identified by ID

Cookie-based authentication
Step 1. Create a new session using the Jira REST API
Step 2. Use the session cookie in a request
This page shows you how to allow REST clients to authenticate
themselves using cookies. This is one of three methods that you can
use for authentication against the Jira REST API;
the other two are Basic authentication and OAuth.
